## GET STARTED

To start the docker containers you need to run docker engine software then exec the following command in the ROOT directory of the project

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build`

use the -d to build the containers without logs

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d`

to show the logs of a specific container you can run

`docker logs [container_name] --follow`

example
`docker logs backend-service --follow`

to stop the containers you can `ctrl + c` inside the terminal or run the following command in the ROOT directory of the project

`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down`

to install a package in your package.json run the following commands
`docker exec -it backend-service npm install [package-name]`

sometimes you may also install the package and its types locally in you project folder so run `npm install [package-name]`in ./backend

## DATABASE CONNEXION

user `docker stop [container-name] to stop a sp√©cific container`
